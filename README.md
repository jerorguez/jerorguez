## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!


<p align="justify">
I am Jerobel Rodriguez, throughout my life I have focused my studies to be a doctor/dentist. 
It is not until the year 2021 where I discovered my true vocation for software development. 
I am currently studying to become a web application developer.

I am very interested in backend, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
